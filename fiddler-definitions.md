The [section 2.3 of the HTTP specification](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#intermediaries) defines a proxy as follows:

> A "proxy" is a message-forwarding agent that is selected by the client, usually via local configuration rules, to receive requests for some type(s) of absolute URI and attempt to satisfy those requests via translation through the HTTP interface. Some translations are minimal, such as for proxy requests for "http" URIs, whereas other requests might require translation to and from entirely different application-level protocols. Proxies are often used to group an organization's HTTP requests through a common intermediary for the sake of security, annotation services, or shared caching.

Fiddler is a proxy that acts as an [intermediary](https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#intermediaries) between the user agent (i.e. browser) and the network. Requests intercepted by Fiddler are recorded and then forwarded onto the next intermediary or origin server:

Many developers use Fiddler in this manner; to record web traffic that's generated by a user agent. However, since Fiddler is a proxy, it may also be used to process this web traffic. The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to operate in this manner. The act of processing web traffic can include responding to inbound messages; Fiddler can be configured to respond to messages that match a set of criteria. For example, Fiddler's [AutoResponder](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder) may be configured to serve local files (acting as a cache) or perform actions for messages it receives:

This is a useful strategy during development for mocking API responses from a service that may not yet be available for testing. The AutoResponder may also be configured with a latency setting to simulate a more realistic response time.

The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to transform messages and their payloads. Fiddler is capable of transforming messages through custom rules.
