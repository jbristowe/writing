Fiddler operates as a proxy as defined by [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). That means it acts as an [intermediary](https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#intermediaries) between the user agent (i.e. browser) and the network. Requests intercepted by Fiddler are recorded and then forwarded onto the next intermediary or origin server:

Most of the time, Fiddler is used in this manner in order to record, inspect, and/or debug web traffic that's generated by user agents.

As a proxy, Fiddler may process the messages it receives. The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to operate in this manner. The act of processing web traffic can include responding to inbound messages; Fiddler can be configured to respond to messages that match a set of criteria. For example, Fiddler's [AutoResponder](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder) may be configured to serve local files (acting as a cache) or perform actions for messages it receives:

This is a useful strategy during development for mocking API responses from a service that may not yet be available for testing. The AutoResponder may also be configured to simulate latency.

The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to transform messages and their payloads. Fiddler is capable of transforming messages through custom rules.
