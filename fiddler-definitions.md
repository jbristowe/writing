Fiddler operates as a proxy as defined by [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). That means it acts as an [intermediary](https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#intermediaries) between the user agent (i.e. browser) and the network. Requests intercepted by Fiddler are recorded and then forwarded onto the next intermediary or origin server:

Most of the time, Fiddler is used in this manner; to record and forward web traffic that's generated by a user agent. However, since Fiddler is a proxy, it may also process this web traffic. The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to operate in this manner. The act of processing web traffic can include responding to inbound messages; Fiddler can be configured to respond to messages that match a set of criteria. For example, Fiddler's [AutoResponder](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder) may be configured to serve local files (acting as a cache) or perform actions for messages it receives:

This is a useful strategy during development for mocking API responses from a service that may not yet be available for testing. The AutoResponder may also be configured with a latency setting to simulate a more realistic response time.

The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to transform messages and their payloads. Fiddler is capable of transforming messages through custom rules.
