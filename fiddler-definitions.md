## What is a Proxy?

The [section 2.3 of the HTTP specification](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#intermediaries) defines a proxy as:

> a message-forwarding agent that is **selected by the client**, usually via local configuration rules, to receive requests for some type(s) of absolute URI and attempt to satisfy those requests via translation through the HTTP interface

The phrase, "selected by the client" (above) is a distinguishing characteristic; a proxy is specialised node in a network topology because it is designated by a "user agent" (UA) to convey messages as part of a communication chain. (Browsers like Chrome and Firefox common examples of UAs.) A proxy participates in transporting messages between a UA and an "origin server" (i.e. google.com).

In the reverse, a proxy is defined as a "reverse proxy" or "gateway". In other words, an origin server for outbound messages; it translates requests and forwards them inbound.

## Telerik Fiddler as a Proxy

[Telerik Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) (or Fiddler) is a proxy that acts as an [intermediary](https://httpwg.org/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html#intermediaries) between the user agent (i.e. browser) and the network. Requests intercepted by Fiddler are recorded and then forwarded onto the next intermediary or origin server:

Many developers use Fiddler in this manner; to record web traffic that's generated by a user agent. However, since Fiddler is a proxy, it may also process this web traffic. The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to operate in this manner. The act of processing web traffic can include responding to inbound messages. Fiddler can be configured to respond to messages that match a set of criteria. For example, Fiddler's [AutoResponder](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/KnowledgeBase/AutoResponder) may be configured to serve local files (acting as a cache) or perform actions for messages it receives:

This can be a useful development strategy when resources and/or services may be unavailable. For example, Fiddler may be used to mock API responses from a service. The AutoResponder may also be configured with a latency setting to simulate a more realistic response time.

The HTTP specification enables intermediaries to transform messages and their payloads (see [section 5.7.2](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#message.transformations)). Fiddler is capable of transforming messages through custom rules.
