## jQuery

jQuery continues to be very popular in the web application space. The statistics for jQuery can vary across organisations measuring its use on the web; the general consensus is that it continues to be a popular library. At the time of this writing, [jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library used across the top 1 million sites according to BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript). For many web developers, jQuery provides a valuable set of functions for performing operations like HTML document traversal and event handling in a way that's compatible across browsers.

The most recent stable release (v3.3.1) shipped on January 20, 2018. The release of v3.4.0 is anticipated to ship sometime in 2019. At the time of this writing, v3.4.0 is 70% complete (38 closed issues, 16 open issues) according to its [milestone tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestone/18). Generally, the next version of jQuery is not expected to add many new features ([jQuery 3.4.0 roadmap](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Roadmap#jquery-340)). The development team favors a philosophy adding features only when necessary and when [a particular set of criteria is met](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Adding-new-features). Often, newer versions of jQuery will see more deprecations than features. That's in large part to innovations in the underlying browsers along with their usage trends have reduced/eliminated the necessity for certain functions. It is likely that jQuery 3.4.0 will deprecate some of these functions. It is also likely that few small and specific features will also be added to existing functions to support the evolving nature of the underlying platform.

Looking ahead, jQuery will continue to be a popular choice for building web applications in 2019. And yet, web developers may consider moving from it as browsers continue to evolve. This is evidenced by opinions voiced by web developers on social media and supported by the growing popularity of sites like [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/).
